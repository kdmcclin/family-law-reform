#Family Law Reform

##Purpose
This is a basic rails app integrated within a prototype website for the National Foundation for Family Law Reform.  The organization is a clearinghouse for all ongoing efforts to modify, reform, or re-invent family law.  It serves as both a repository for/explanation of useful links, as well as a reporting service.  Users can register complaints against legal professionals in their state or in whichever state they are involved.
